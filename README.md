# Party Central

A game produced for the 2020 GMTK GameJam.

## Description

You are a slightly less-than-ethical teenager that has fallen in love. But your person of interest expects attention and lavish gifts. Many hints have been dropped that a certain $10,000 ring would be perfect.

You have decided to "embrace the chaos" and hold house parties to earn money. There are 20 times that you know that your parents are out-of-town for the night. If you can host the party; sell enough party drinks, flirt with your love, and get the place clean before the parents come home; you might just pull it off.

Goals:

* Keep flirting enough to keep your love's interested high.
* Yet, spend enough cleaning up after the guests to prevent your parents from catching on.
* Yet, keep the party going long enough to make the $10K before the 20 nights are over.

## Technical Details

The program has been written in C# with the Unity game framework. The following free artwork has been used:
